we prefer to have a side dish with roti-sabzi or dal-rice combo. so i usually prepare a raita or a quick stir fry veggie dish. not only one gets more variety, but these are healthy too.

this masala raita as the name suggests have some spice powders apart from onions and coriander leaves. adding onions are optional in the raita. we like onions in raita, as it gives a nice crunch to the raita. thus i add them. but you can skip them also.

i always prepare curd a night before, for making any curd based dishes like raita or curd rice. you can use store bought curd also. if you are new to preparing curd at home, then you can check this method of making curd at home.
the curd can be used once its set or even chilled curd can be used. refrigerate this raita after preparing it. you can also serve the raita chilled.

serve masala raita with dal-rice or roti-sabzi combo or stuffed parathas. this raita also goes very well with any veg pulao or biryani.
